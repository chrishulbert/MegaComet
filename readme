MegaComet
---------

"Mega- (symbol M) is an prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of million"

This is my (ambitious!) attempt to create a comet server that can handle 1 million concurrent connections on an Amazon EC2 'large' server.

It requires libev to compile. So far, only being developed on my Mac. When it gets good enough, i'll make it work on an EC2 box.
